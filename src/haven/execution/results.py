"""Execution result contracts.

`Plan` / `PlanStatus` (owned by Person A, in `haven.models.plan`) only
carry a *proposal* lifecycle (`PROPOSED`, `AWAITING_CONFIRMATION`); by
design, execution states are not part of that contract yet. These types
are execution's own boundary: what the executor hands to the verifier,
and what the verifier and MCP layer read back.
