"""MCP tool: `execute_household_plan`.

Executes a previously proposed plan (looked up by id in the server's
`PlanStore`) and immediately verifies the result — Haven's Layer 4
("execute, then check") is not a separate MCP tool; it always happens as
part of executing a plan, matching how `scripts/run_movie_night.py`
chains `execute_plan` straight into `verify_plan` locally.
