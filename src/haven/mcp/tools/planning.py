"""MCP tools: `propose_household_plan`, `get_plan_status`.

Proposing a plan resolves context the same way `get_household_context`
does, then hands it to Person A's planner. Nothing is executed here —
that's `haven.mcp.tools.execution.execute_household_plan`. The proposed
plan is kept in the server's `PlanStore` (`haven.mcp.server`) so a later
`get_plan_status` or `execute_household_plan` call can find it by id.
